# Noota AI Meeting Assistant: Record Every Word, Miss Nothing, Reclaim Your Day

So here's a story you've probably lived.

You walk out of a two-hour meeting feeling pretty good about yourself. Good conversation, lots of ideas flying around, maybe even some actual decisions made. Then you sit down at your desk, open a blank doc, and... nothing. The meeting dissolved into air somewhere between the conference room and your chair.

You end up spending another hour trying to reconstruct what happened from memory and half-legible scribbles. And then you send a follow-up email that is, let's be honest, mostly vibes.

That's the problem Noota is here to solve. And it does it pretty elegantly.

## What Is Noota, Exactly?

Noota is an AI meeting assistant born in Paris — which already gives it a certain flair — that automatically records, transcribes, and summarizes your meetings. It works across Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Webex, plus in-person meetings and phone calls. Over 100,000 users and companies like Carrefour, Uber, and Google have brought it into their workflows.

The pitch is simple: you talk, Noota listens, and when the meeting ends, you get a clean, structured report with action items, key decisions, and even a draft follow-up email waiting for you.

No more reconstructing conversations from memory. No more "sorry, what did we decide about the budget?" emails.

## The Features That Actually Matter

**Transcription in 50+ Languages**

Noota's transcription accuracy sits below 6% word error rate, with speaker distinction built in. Whether your team is spread across Paris, São Paulo, and Singapore, it handles accents and multilingual meetings without melting down.

**AI Meeting Notes and Custom Reports**

After each meeting, the AI generates structured notes — not just a wall of text, but organized by topics, decisions, and action items. You can customize templates to match what your team actually needs: candidate evaluation scorecards for recruiters, deal summaries for sales reps, status reports for project managers.

**AI Email Automation**

This one is weirdly satisfying. Based on your meeting content, Noota drafts a follow-up email, already adjusted to the right tone (professional, friendly, concise — you pick). You review, tweak if needed, send. What used to take 20 minutes happens in about 45 seconds.

**Phone Call Recording**

Record calls directly from Noota using your own number, with automatic transcription. There's also a Chrome extension that lets you click any phone number on a webpage and start a recorded call instantly. Recruiters and sales teams tend to love this one.

**Knowledge Management and Search**

Every meeting you've ever recorded becomes searchable. Ask Noota where a decision was made three weeks ago, and it finds it. The AI indexes and connects conversations across time, so your meeting history actually becomes useful instead of just existing.

**CRM and Tool Integrations**

Noota connects with Salesforce, HubSpot, Bullhorn, Notion, Slack, and 100+ other tools. Your CRM updates automatically. Notes flow to where they're needed. The manual data entry loop gets broken.

**Enterprise-Grade Security**

All data is encrypted and stored in EU data centers. Noota is GDPR compliant, SOC2 certified, and ISO 27001 certified. There's even a sovereign hosting option certified by ANSSI for organizations that need it.

## Who's It Really For?

Noota has built specific workflows for several use cases:

**Recruiters** use it to transcribe interviews, generate candidate reports automatically, and sync everything to their ATS. One user reported cutting their post-interview documentation time from 1.5–2 hours down to 15–20 minutes.

**Sales teams** use it to track objections and buying signals during calls, auto-update their CRM, and generate follow-up emails right after hanging up.

**Consultants and project managers** use it to capture client meeting discussions, create client-ready documentation, and ensure alignment across distributed teams.

**Podcasters and media professionals** have been using it since the early days to transcribe long-form audio without the headache.

## Noota Pricing Plans

Here's how the plans break down. The good news: there's a free tier that gets you started without a credit card, and the paid plans are priced for individual users rather than demanding whole-team commitments right out of the gate.

| Plan | Price (Monthly) | Price (Annual) | Best For |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Free** | €0 | €0 | Testing the basics |
| **Solo** | ~€18/mo | ~€10/mo | Individual professionals |
| **Pro** | ~€35/mo | ~€22/mo | Power users, CRM integrations |
| **Business** | Custom / ~€49/mo | Custom | Teams, live coaching, workspaces |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Large orgs, sovereign hosting |

The **Free plan** gives you access to core features — basic AI summaries, search, screen recording — to see if the tool fits before committing anything.

The **Solo plan** unlocks higher transcription storage, multi-uploads, file imports, and document exports. Good for someone who just wants the meetings handled and doesn't need team features.

The **Pro plan** is where it gets interesting: unlimited transcription credits, CRM integrations, conversation intelligence, and a full suite of summary templates. If you're in sales or recruiting and doing multiple meetings a day, this pays for itself fast.

The **Business plan** adds live coaching during meetings, workspace collaboration for teams, invoice payments, and dedicated support. Larger orgs will want to talk to the sales team directly for pricing.

## What Real Users Are Saying

The reviews across Capterra and other platforms tell a pretty consistent story:

"Noota has fast become my essential meeting assistant... what sets it apart are its strong privacy safeguards: data is encrypted and hosted on EU infrastructure."

"With Noota, you can work faster and focus on high-value tasks. What used to take me 1.5 to 2 hours for restitutions now only takes 15 to 20 minutes."

"It's like having the perfect assistant, except it never steals the biscuits or complains when people talk too fast."

The common critique, occasionally, is that transcription for some languages still requires a bit of manual cleanup. But the team ships updates regularly, and French transcription in particular gets singled out for praise (probably helps that they're a French company with skin in the game).

## How It Compares to the Alternatives

The AI meeting assistant space is getting crowded — Otter.ai, Fireflies, Grain, Fathom, Fellow. Most do the core recording and transcription job reasonably well.

Where Noota stands out is the combination of: EU-based infrastructure (matters a lot for European companies dealing with GDPR), deep phone call integration, strong recruiter-specific workflows, and the AI email automation layer on top of notes.

If you're a US-based individual user with no compliance concerns and just want transcripts, the competition is stiff. But if data residency matters, if you're doing high-volume interviews or sales calls, or if your team needs structured reports rather than raw transcripts, Noota is worth a serious look.

## Getting Started

The free plan is genuinely free — no credit card, no trial that auto-charges after 14 days. You sign up, connect your calendar or Google Meet or Zoom, and the bot starts joining your meetings. The Chrome extension handles in-browser recordings and the click-to-call feature.

Onboarding is quick. Most people have their first meeting recorded and summarized within the first hour of signing up.

## The Bottom Line

Noota won't make your meetings less boring — that's on you. But it will make sure that when a good meeting happens, nothing valuable disappears into the ether afterward.

For anyone doing multiple meetings a day with real decisions and follow-through involved, the math is simple. The tool handles the documentation. You handle the thinking. That's a trade worth making.
